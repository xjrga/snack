#### Snack: Learning Software For Nutrition
 
 Snack's ultimate purpose is to empower its users to make better nutrition
decisions that will improve their diet, nutrition, health and quality of life.
	 
 It is a user-friendly software application that calculates the nutritional value
of food mixtures.
	
 It is also a meal design tool and calculator that could facilitate achieving
your health goals and objectives by first helping you understand your food intake 
and second by allowing you to create new food combinations that meet specific 
dietary requirements. 
	
 It is also a training program designed to find food combinations that minimize 
nutritional deficiencies. It lets you inexpensively experiment to get faster and 
better results so you can rapidly learn and improve.
	
 Its intended audience is anyone with interest in nutrition.
 
 We would like to invite all nutrition scientists, registered dietitians and 
nutrition / food / animal science students and food producers to use the application
and share their insight.
